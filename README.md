# Play-By-Email (PBEM)

## Overview

A simple .NET game application to play board games by email.

Initially this application supports the rules "*One-Hour Wargames: Practical Tabletop Battles For Those With Limited Time and Space*" played on a 6 by 6 square grid.

## Coding Notes

I chose F# specifically because I tend towards a more function-oriented programming style due to my JavaScript roots, meaning it is partially procedural/imperative, partially functional, and partially object-oriented. In other words a hodge-podge that did not settle on any one style.

I see F# as being the closest .NET language that allows me to maintain that messy thinking while getting things done. It is not completely alien. That said, I want to move towards a more functional style and I feel this is the way to do it. (Despite "*Functional Programming in C#*" being an excellent book, I just couldn't get from here to there in C#. Besides, writing C# code in a functional style looks like you are writing bad code; it doesn't in F#.)

All of that said, if anyone happens across this code and has constructive suggestions on whipping my F# code into a more functional style, feel free to join in! I know, for example, I have to stop using *for .. in .. do* loops and start using *List.filter* and other list processing functions. I will get there. 🙂
